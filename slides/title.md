Note:
- The first C++ standard was published on 1998 with a small bug fix update on 2003.
- After being stale for over a decade, starting from 2011, the standard switched to a train model where a new standard is being released every 3 years.
- In this series we're going to discuss the new language and library features added to the C++ standard in the new revisons released since.
- On each session we will have one main topic and smaller features will be introduced as needed.
- Let's start.
